# TSA2023 - Scurry (Teacher Side)
This Project is done by Caitlyn Parris-Lewis, Saakshi Munot, Suchi Borkar, Kyran Park and Ollie Koenders.

It aims to replicate Learning Management Systems like Canvas and Google Classroon, but in more kid-friendly way. Specifically, students can earn acorns for completing assignments. These acorns can then be used to customize their avatar. This makes schoolwork more fun and interactive!

This repo contains the teacher side implementation of Scurry.
